///
/// This API is normally called from threads, and can only be successfully
/// called from interupt handlers under special conditions.
///
/// If the internal count of the \a semaphore is non-zero, the internal count
/// is decremented by one and execution of the caller continues.
///
/// If the internal count of the \a semaphore is zero and the \a timeout is
/// SSX_NO_WAIT (0) then the call returns immediately with the informational
/// code -SSX_SEMAPHORE_PEND_NO_WAIT.
///
/// If the internal count of the \a semaphore is zero and the \a timeout is
/// non-zero then a thread will block until either a semaphore count is
/// acquired or the relative timeout expires.  If this condition occurs in a
/// call from an interrupt context or before threads have been started then
/// the call will fail with the error \c -SSX_SEMAPHORE_PEND_WOULD_BLOCK.
///
/// Once timed out the thread is removed from the semaphore pending queue and
/// made runnable, and the ssx_semaphore_pend() operation will fail, even if
/// the semaphore count becomes available before the thread runs again. The
/// ssx_semaphore_pend() API returns the informational code
/// -SSX_SEMAPHORE_PEND_TIMED_OUT in this case.
///
/// By convention, a timeout interval equal to the maximum possible value of
/// the \c SsxInterval type is taken to mean "wait forever".  A thread blocked
/// on a semaphore in this mode will never time out. SSX provides this
/// constant as \c SSX_WAIT_FOREVER.
///
/// Return values other than SSX_OK (0) are not necessarily errors; see \ref
/// ssx_errors 
///
/// The following return codes are non-error codes:
///
/// \retval 0 Successful completion
///
/// \retval -SSX_SEMAPHORE_PEND_NO_WAIT timeout is set to SSX_NO_WAIT
///
/// \retval -SSX_SEMAPHORE_PEND_TIMED_OUT The semaphore was not acquired
/// before the timeout expired.
///
/// The following return codes are error codes:
///
/// \retval -SSX_ILLEGAL_CONTEXT The API was called from a critical interrupt
/// context.
///
/// \retval -SSX_INVALID_SEMAPHORE_AT_PEND The \a semaphore is a null (0) 
/// pointer.
/// 
/// \retval -SSX_SEMAPHORE_PEND_WOULD_BLOCK The call was made from an
/// interrupt context (or before threads have been started), the semaphore
/// internal count was 0 and a non-zero timeout was specified.
