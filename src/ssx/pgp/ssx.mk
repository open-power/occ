#  Make header for PgP SSX builds
#
# The application may define the following variables to control the
# build process:
#
# APP_INCLUDES       : Aplication-specific header search paths
#
# DEFS               : A string of -D<symbol>[=<value>] to control compilation
#
# SSX                : Default ..; The path to the SSX source code.
#                      The default is set for building the SSX
#                      subdirectories. 
#
# SSX_THREAD_SUPPORT : (0/1, default 1); Compile SSX thread and
#                      semaphore suppprt 
#
# SSX_TIMER_SUPPORT  : (0/1, default 1); Compile SSX timer suppprt
#
# PPC405_MMU_SUPPORT : (0/1, default 1); Compile for PPC405 simple MMU protection
#
# SIMICS_ENVIRONMENT : (0/1, current default 0); Compile for Simics
#
# SIMICS_MAGIC_PANIC : (0/1, current default 0); Use Simics Magic
#                      breakpoint for SSX_PANIC() instead of PowerPC trap.
#                      Note that Simics does not model trap correctly in
#                      external debug mode.
#
# GCC-O-LEVEL        : The optimization level passed to GCC (default -Os). May
#                      also be defined empty (GCC-O-LEVEL=) to disable
#                      optimization. This variable can also be used to pass
#                      any other non-default setting to GCC, e.g.
#                      make GCC-O-LEVEL="-Os -fno-branch-count-reg"
#
# GCC-TOOL-PREFIX    : The full path (including executable file prefixes) to
#                      the GCC cross-development tools to use.  The default is 
#                      "ppcnf-mcp5-"

#
# GCC Compiler flags used in these builds.  Comments, or reasons for
# non-obvious choices appear in [] after the GCC documentation.
#
#`-Os'
#     Optimize for size.  `-Os' enables all `-O2' optimizations that do
#     not typically increase code size.  It also performs further
#     optimizations designed to reduce code size.
#
#     `-Os' disables the following optimization flags:
#          -falign-functions  -falign-jumps  -falign-loops
#          -falign-labels  -freorder-blocks  -freorder-blocks-and-partition
#          -fprefetch-loop-arrays  -ftree-vect-loop-version
#
#     If you use multiple `-O' options, with or without level numbers,
#     the last such option is the one that is effective.
#
#`-g'
#     Produce debugging information in the operating system's native
#     format (stabs, COFF, XCOFF, or DWARF 2).  GDB can work with this
#     debugging information.
#
#     On most systems that use stabs format, `-g' enables use of extra
#     debugging information that only GDB can use; this extra information
#     makes debugging work better in GDB but will probably make other
#     debuggers crash or refuse to read the program.  If you want to
#     control for certain whether to generate the extra information, use
#     `-gstabs+', `-gstabs', `-gxcoff+', `-gxcoff', or `-gvms' (see
#     below).
#
#     GCC allows you to use `-g' with `-O'.  The shortcuts taken by
#     optimized code may occasionally produce surprising results: some
#     variables you declared may not exist at all; flow of control may
#     briefly move where you did not expect it; some statements may not
#     be executed because they compute constant results or their values
#     were already at hand; some statements may execute in different
#     places because they were moved out of loops.
#
#     Nevertheless it proves possible to debug optimized output.  This
#     makes it reasonable to use the optimizer for programs that might
#     have bugs.
#
#`-Wall'
#     Turns on all optional warnings which are desirable for normal code.
#     At present this is `-Wcomment', `-Wtrigraphs', `-Wmultichar' and a
#     warning about integer promotion causing a change of sign in `#if'
#     expressions.  Note that many of the preprocessor's warnings are on
#     by default and have no options to control them.
#
#`-Werror'
#     Make all warnings into errors.
#  
#`-fsigned-char'
#     Let the type `char' be signed, like `signed char'.
#
#     Note that this is equivalent to `-fno-unsigned-char', which is the
#     negative form of `-funsigned-char'.  Likewise, the option
#     `-fno-signed-char' is equivalent to `-funsigned-char'.
#
#`-msoft-float'
#     Generate output containing library calls for floating point.
#     *Warning:* the requisite libraries are not available for all ARM
#     targets.  Normally the facilities of the machine's usual C
#     compiler are used, but this cannot be done directly in
#     cross-compilation.  You must make your own arrangements to provide
#     suitable library functions for cross-compilation.
#
#     `-msoft-float' changes the calling convention in the output file;
#     therefore, it is only useful if you compile _all_ of a program with
#     this option.  In particular, you need to compile `libgcc.a', the
#     library that comes with GCC, with `-msoft-float' in order for this
#     to work.
#
#`-pipe'
#     Use pipes rather than temporary files for communication between the
#     various stages of compilation.  This fails to work on some systems
#     where the assembler is unable to read from a pipe; but the GNU
#     assembler has no trouble.
#
#`-mmultiple'
#`-mno-multiple'
#     Generate code that uses (does not use) the load multiple word
#     instructions and the store multiple word instructions.  These
#     instructions are generated by default on POWER systems, and not
#     generated on PowerPC systems.  Do not use `-mmultiple' on little
#     endian PowerPC systems, since those instructions do not work when
#     the processor is in little endian mode.  The exceptions are PPC740
#     and PPC750 which permit the instructions usage in little endian
#     mode.
#
#`-mstring'
#`-mno-string'
#     Generate code that uses (does not use) the load string instructions
#     and the store string word instructions to save multiple registers
#     and do small block moves.  These instructions are generated by
#     default on POWER systems, and not generated on PowerPC systems.
#     Do not use `-mstring' on little endian PowerPC systems, since those
#     instructions do not work when the processor is in little endian
#     mode.  The exceptions are PPC740 and PPC750 which permit the
#     instructions usage in little endian mode.
#
#`-meabi'
#`-mno-eabi'
#     On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems do (do not) adhere to
#     the Embedded Applications Binary Interface (eabi) which is a set of
#     modifications to the System V.4 specifications.  Selecting `-meabi'
#     means that the stack is aligned to an 8 byte boundary, a function
#     `__eabi' is called to from `main' to set up the eabi environment,
#     and the `-msdata' option can use both `r2' and `r13' to point to
#     two separate small data areas.  Selecting `-mno-eabi' means that
#     the stack is aligned to a 16 byte boundary, do not call an
#     initialization function from `main', and the `-msdata' option will
#     only use `r13' to point to a single small data area.  The `-meabi'
#     option is on by default if you configured GCC using one of the
#     `powerpc*-*-eabi*' options.
#
# [We elected to use the EABI to reduce stack requirements and possibly reduce
# code size and improve performance.  In practice it probably has little real
# effect since the code size and performance improvements only apply to global
# variables <= 8 bytes, and our applications will not have deeply nested call
# trees. Still, much of the assembler code requires/assumes the EABI is in
# place, and it certainly doesn't hurt anything to use it.]
#
#`-msdata=eabi'
#     On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems, put small initialized
#     `const' global and static data in the `.sdata2' section, which is
#     pointed to by register `r2'.  Put small initialized non-`const'
#     global and static data in the `.sdata' section, which is pointed
#     to by register `r13'.  Put small uninitialized global and static
#     data in the `.sbss' section, which is adjacent to the `.sdata'
#     section.  The `-msdata=eabi' option is incompatible with the
#     `-mrelocatable' option.  The `-msdata=eabi' option also sets the
#     `-memb' option.
#
#`-memb'
#     On embedded PowerPC systems, set the PPC_EMB bit in the ELF flags
#     header to indicate that `eabi' extended relocations are used.
#
#`-ffreestanding'
#     Assert that compilation takes place in a freestanding environment.
#     This implies `-fno-builtin'.  A freestanding environment is one
#     in which the standard library may not exist, and program startup
#     may not necessarily be at `main'.  The most obvious example is an
#     OS kernel.  This is equivalent to `-fno-hosted'.
#
#`-fno-common'
#     In C, allocate even uninitialized global variables in the data
#     section of the object file, rather than generating them as common
#     blocks.  This has the effect that if the same variable is declared
#     (without `extern') in two different compilations, you will get an
#     error when you link them.  The only reason this might be useful is
#     if you wish to verify that the program will work on other systems
#     which always work this way.
#
# [It is always assumed to be an error if two C source files declare global
# variables of the same name, since it is not clear whether this was intended
# or not.]
# 
#`-finline-functions-called-once'
#`-fno-inline-functions-called-once'
#     Consider all `static' functions called once for inlining into their
#     caller even if they are not marked `inline'.  If a call to a given
#     function is integrated, then the function is not output as
#     assembler code in its own right.
#
#     Enabled if `-funit-at-a-time' is enabled.
#
# [There is a 'bug' in GCC related to inlining static, called-once
# functions. GCC allocates stack space in the caller for the stacks of ALL
# inlined functions of this type, even if they are called sequentially,
# leading in some cases to kilobytes of wasted stack space. If you want to
# inline a static called-once function you will need to explicity declare it
# as 'inline'.]
