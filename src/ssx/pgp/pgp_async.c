/// \file pgp_async.c
/// \brief Support for asynchronous request queuing and callback mechanisms
///
/// This file implements device drivers for asynchronous requests.  The model
/// for devices like the PORE engines and the PBA block copy engines is that
/// the application creates self-contained requests for jobs to run on the
/// engine.  The application then schedules the request and continues normal
/// processing, or threads can request to simply block in place until the
/// request finishes.  Queue management is handled in the interrupt handler
/// for the engine. As each queued job finishes, the next request (if any) is
/// started on the engine and the optional callback is invoked or scheduled.
///
/// The application can either use a polling protocol or the asynchronous
/// callback mechanism to determine the state of the request.  A timeout
/// mechanism is also provided that cancels or kills a job that does not
/// complete within a fixed time. Error handling in the event that the request
/// does not complete in time or has failed is standardized by the
/// implementation, but can be overridden by the application.
///
/// Asynchronous request interrupt handlers can run either as critical or
/// noncritical handlers.  Some engines may support queuing requests that
/// complete immediately; therefore the kernel context of the callback may be
/// either a thread or interupt context, and in general, callbacks should not
/// make assumptions about the kernel context when they run.
///
/// If the callback is non-NULL and the request was created with \c
/// ASYNC_CALLBACK_IMMEDIATE, the callback is then immediately invoked in the
/// current context. In general, immediate callbacks should be short and sweet
/// (to reduce interrupt latency) and should not make SSX kernel calls.
///
/// If the request has a non-NULL callback and was created with \c
/// ASYNC_CALLBACK_DEFERRED then the callback will be deferred to a
/// noncritical interrupt context. Deferred callbacks are queued, then run
/// later in response to a reserved IPI.  Deferred callbacks always run as
/// noncritical interrupt handlers with noncritical interrupts \e enabled,
/// similar to SSX timer callbacks.
///
/// If the request has a non-null callback and was created with \c
/// ASYNC_CALLBACK_NONCRITICAL, then the callback will be run immediately from
/// a noncritical handler or thread environment, or deferred from a critical
/// interrupt context.  Similar to immediate callbacks, callbacks marked
/// noncritical should be short and sweet (to reduce interrupt latency), but
/// may make SSX kernel calls.
///
/// Regardless of whether the callback is critical or noncritical, the
/// callback is coded as a normal C or assembler subroutine with a single
/// void* argument.
///
/// As a programming shortcut, the AsyncRequest includes a semaphore object.
/// A special AsyncRequest option ASYNC_REQUEST_BLOCKING indicates that the
/// thread scheduling the request should block on the semaphore of the
/// AsyncRequest (with SSX_WAIT_FOREVER) until the request is complete. Note
/// that a separate callback can be specified even if ASYNC_REQUEST_BLOCKING
/// is specified.
///
/// Requests are always timestamped. The \a start_time field of the request is
/// set from the SSX timebase when the request is first 'run' on the device.
/// Request types that may require multiple back-to-back 'runs' (like PBA
/// block copies with more than 4K data) only record the initial 'run'. The \a
/// end_time field of the request is set from the SSX timebase when the job
/// finishes on the hardware, but before any callback is run.  These
/// timestamps cover time intervals not visible to the application; The
/// application is responsible for timestamping the period between request
/// queing and the \a start_time, and between the \a end_time and callback
/// completion if required.  The timestamps can be robustly recovered from the
/// request using the API async_request_timestamps_get().
///
/// This is largely a generic implementation, designed to reduce code space by
/// allowing the PORE, PBA and OCB drivers to use the same generic data
/// structures and code.  This is supported by the 'single-inheritence class
/// hierarchy' described in the comments for pgp_async.h.
///
/// <b> Request Completion and Callback States </b>
///
/// The application can determine what happend to the job by observing the
/// request state and callback return code when the request becomes idle.
/// A request is not considered idle until the job has run to completion or
/// been aborted, any callback has been run, any timeout has been cancelled,
/// and any thread pending on request completion has been maxde runnable.
///
/// Normally the application should see the request state (\a request->state)
/// ASYNC_REQUEST_STATE_COMPLETE and a  callback return code 
/// (\a request=->callback_rc) of 0 which indicates that the job and callback
/// both completed normally.  If the request did not complete normally it
/// could be due to one of several reasons.  For further analysis the request
/// also includes a field \a abort_state that records the state the job was in
/// when it was aborted (i.e., cancelled, killed, timed out or error-out).
///
/// <b> Timeout Semantics </b>
///
/// Any timeout other than SSX_WAIT_FOREVER specifies a timeout covering the
/// interval spanning the time a job is scheduled until the time the job
/// completes on the hardware.  If the job is still wating to execute when it
/// times out then the job is simply removed from the queue and marked as
/// having timed out.  If the job is running when it times out then the job is
/// forceably removed from the hardware, which may have unintended or
/// indeterminate consequences. The application may need to consider whether
/// it is safe to continue after a forced timeout.
///
/// Specifying a timeout involves quite a bit of overhead, since a timer needs
/// to be scheduled and cancelled each time a job is run.  If the interrupt
/// handler for a device is a critical handler then the timeout cancellation
/// will need to be deferred to the callback queue, potentially increasing
/// overhead even further.
///
/// <b> Implementation Notes </b>
///
/// - The \e queue objects will normally be global data structures that
/// persist throughout the life of the application.
///
/// - The \e request objects may be either global or local data
/// structures. However, since \e request objects are not copied, and pointers
/// to them are stored in the \e queue objects, \a request objects should not
/// be allocated on the stack if the stack frame could become invalid before
/// the request completes.
///
/// \todo Once all function is developed and tested, convert interrupt
/// handling to fast-mode assembler routines.

// The handler for the asynchronous callback queue
//
// This is a full-mode noncritical interrupt handler.  It is activated to run
// 1) all deferred callbacks, and 2) noncritical callbacks invoked from
// critical interrupt handlers, and 3) Thread-unblock and/or timeout-cancel
// requests that needed to be deferred to a noncritical context. The callback
// is enqueued in the SsxDeque passed as the private argument, and an IPI is
// used to activate this handler.
//
// This handler runs each callback in order.  Since the callback queue may be
// managed by critical interrupt handlers we need to disable critical
// interrupts when popping the next element from the queue.
//
// Deferred callbacks are run with noncritical interrupts \e enabled, similar
// to how timer callbacks are run.
//
// Noncritical callbacks that were deferred here (by being invoked from a
// critical handler) run with interrupts \e disabled, to be consistent with
// the expected environment. Interrupts are then renabled briefly for
// interrupt latency mitigation.
//
// Note that NULL callbacks may be enqueued here but only in the state
// ASYNC_REQUEST_STATE_POSTPROCESSING.

// The handler runs with its own IRQ disabled to avoid infinite interrupt
// loops caused by enabling interrupt preemption. The IRQ status can only be
// cleared inside an SSX_CRITICAL critical section.  For efficiency we only do
// this when we know that no more callbacks are queued.

// Final request completion has been broken out into a generic routine,
// async_request_finalize().  This routine is also called by the PTS
// completion queue handler, which handles its requests ion a slightly
// different way from the other async handlers.
