# TODO: Aren't trace strings hashed out of the image already?
# If this makefile is called as "make NO_TRAC_STRINGS=1" then trace strings 
# won't be built into the image.  This will be used for metrics regarded to the 
# realistic OCC Code Size. Note that "make clean" must be run before this define
# will be picked up by the compiler, otherwise previously compiled objects will 
# be used.  You can also see the space used by strings by running: 
# strings occ.bin | \grep "ERR\|INF\|IMP" | sed 's/^...: %s: //g' | wc -m
