#  Description: mk occ application
#
#  This Makefile is included-ed into application Makefiles and
#  encapsulates the steps necessary to create application images.
#
#  The application Makefile (user) must define the following variables:
#
#  APP     - The name of the application
#  SOURCES - The list of local source files that implement the
#            application.
#
#  The application Makefile (user) may optionally define the following
#  variables:  
#
#  D    - The value of $(D) is appended to DEFS defined by ssx.mk
#
#  MODE - The following modes are recognized:
#
#         validation - (Default) An application that requires all SSX
#         services. 
#
#         firmware - An interrupt only configuration. 
#
#  The make process creates the following files:
#
#  $(APP).out  - The PowerPC-ELF version of the application
#  $(APP).bin  - A binary SRAM image of the application
#  $(APP).map  - The linker map of the application
