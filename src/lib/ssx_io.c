/// \file ssx_io.c
/// \brief SSX analog-replacement for C \<stdio.h\> and \<unistd.h\> functions
///
/// The SSX library provides simple analogs for I/O functions found in the
/// typical C libraries and Posix standards. I/O is not considered part of the
/// SSX kernel per-se - I/O is implemented by the application creating I/O
/// abstractions and drivers using the simple SSX kernel services. [However,
/// the ssx_io library does provide a printk() function for use by kernel
/// drivers, so the lines are not completely clear.]
///
/// This library provides a FILE structure or 'base class' to represent a
/// character stream.  Abstractions for different devices will 'derive' a
/// subclass from this base class by including the FILE as the first member of
/// the subclass, and then likely adding more data members.  The FILE
/// structure contains pointers to the routines that implement I/O operations
/// for derived classes. There is no requiremengt that a stream type implement
/// every possible stream operation.  If an unsupported operation is invoked
/// on a stream then the call will simply return -ENXIO, unless otherwise
/// specified.
///
/// The generic I/O calls use the same error-handling protocol as used by the
/// SSX kernel services.  A configuration setting (\c SSX_ERROR_CHECK_API)
/// determines if error checks are made at all, and another setting (\c
/// SSX_ERROR_PANIC) determines whether the presence of a fatal error causes a
/// bad return code or an immediate panic.
///
/// The following errors are never considered fatal errors:
///
/// \b EOF Used to signal end-of-file
///
/// \b EAGAIN Used to signal that an operation was made to a non-blocking
/// stream and the call would block.
///
/// Following are the specifications and requirements for the stream methods
/// that implement a stream type.
///
/// <b> int sread(FILE *stream, void *buf, size_t count, size_t *read) </b>
///
/// The low-level read() function is named sread() here due to differences in
/// the prototype and semantics from the Unix counterpart.  The sread()
/// functions attempts to read \a count bytes from the \a stream into \a buf,
/// sets the number of bytes read, and returns either 0 for success or a
/// negative error code.  The only reason that sread() may terminate without
/// reading \a count bytes is if sread() also returns a negative return
/// code. 
///
/// The device-specific sread() function may assume that the \a stream, \a buf
/// and \a read parameters are non-NULL at entry, and the \a count is greater
/// than 0. These conditions are checked/guaranteed by the generic interface.
///
/// <b> int swrite(FILE *stream, void *buf, size_t count, size_t *written) </b>
///
/// The low-level write() function is named swrite() here due to differences
/// in the prototype and semantics from the Unix counterpart.  The swrite()
/// function attempts to writes \a count bytes from buf to the \a stream, sets
/// the number of bytes written, and returns either 0 for success or a
/// negative error code.  The only reason that swrite() may terminate without
/// writing \a count bytes is if write() also returns a negative return
/// code. 
///
/// The device-specific swrite() function may assume that the \a stream, \a
/// buf and \a written parameters are non-NULL at entry, and the \a count is
/// greater than 0. These conditions are checked/guaranteed by the generic
/// interface.
///
/// <b> int fflush(FILE *stream) </b>
///
/// SSX implements the fflush() call, even though the semantics are slightly
/// different from the Posix standard.  The Posix fflush() returns either 0
/// for success, or EOF to indicate an error.  Here, fflush() returns negative
/// 'errno' codes directly in the event of errors. The Posix standard
/// specifies that calling fflush() with a NULL \a stream causes all open
/// files to be flushed - here it returns the -EBADF error.
///
/// The stream-specific fflush() implementation should return one of the
/// 'errno' codes specified by the Posix standard in the event of
/// problems.
