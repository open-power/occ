// Generic communication using GPSM-DCM 'write' command
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
///
/// These APIs allow applications to perform generic communication over the
/// GPSM-DCM link using the GPSM-DCM 'write' command.  Like all GPSM-DCM
/// commands, communication is always controlled/initiated by the master. The
/// infrastructure assumes that the master and slave applications argee on the
/// maximum amount of data that may be transmitted generically as a single
/// abstract transaction.  It is legal for the data transmission size to be 0.
///
/// In the following APIs, the \a timeout parameter is a timeout for any
/// single send/receive transaction to complete, not a timeout covering the
/// entire send/receive.  The timeout may be specified as SSX_WAIT_FOREVER to
/// indicate no timeout.
///
/// One typical use of these APIs would be to implement a polled 'ping' of the
/// slave from the master.  This sequence might be implemented as follows:
///
/// - Master: Calls gpsm_dcm_write() with 0 size [ping]
/// - Master: Blocks on gpsm_dcm_read [Wait for ping response]
/// - Slave: GpsmSlaveControl.write_handler() is activated to handle the ping
/// - Slave: write_handler() responds by calling gpsm_dcm_write()
/// - Master: Unblocks and processes ping reqponse


/// Send an arbitrary amount of data (max 2^16 - 1 bytes) using GPSM-DCM
///
/// This API is typically used by the master to initiate generic
/// communication.  When received by the slave the application-specific
/// callback is activated on the slave to handle the write.
/// The slave will only use this API when it is known that the master is
/// expecting a communication from the slave and has blocked on a call of
/// gpsm_dcm_read().
///
/// The receiver must be prepared to accept \a size bytes of data, otherwise
/// the call will fail immediately.
///
/// \param buf The buffer contains the sending message prepared by the caller
///
/// \param size The size of a message, in number of bytes, given by the caller
///
/// \param timeout_period The SSX timeout variable
///
/// The firmware level API for sending a generic PMC interchip message
/// This API sends the message by calling lower level API: pmc_dcm_send
///
/// The API times out upon \a timeout_period.
