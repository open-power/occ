/// then as much data as possible is written and swrite returns -EAGAIN.  In
/// all cases swrite() returns the number of bytes actually written to the
/// buffer.
///
/// The sread() method copies data from the StringStream circular buffer to
/// the caller's buffer until either the caller's request is satisfied or all
/// of the immediately available data has been read from the buffer.  If the
/// caller's request can not be immediately granted then as much data as
/// possible is copied and sread() returns -EAGAIN. In all cases sread()
/// returns the number of bytes actually read from the buffer.
///
/// The fflush() method marks the buffer as empty, effectively losing any data
/// currently stored in the buffer.

/// swrite() exceeds the buffer length then the effect is simply to fill the
/// buffer with the final bytes of the caller's data.  swrite() always returns
/// the number of bytes requested to be written.
